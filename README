Apache::AxKit::Language::SpellCheck 

   XML Text Spell Checker

This language module processes an incoming XML document, either loaded
from disk or returned from the previous pipeline stage, and processes
its text nodes with Text::Aspell.  It injects additional XML elements
in the document representing which words are incorrectly spelled, and
optionally offers spelling suggestions.
